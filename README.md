System Overview
The Salary Prediction system is an innovative web application leveraging Machine Learning to forecast salaries based on specific parameters such as experience, years of education, and job location. This system is designed to offer users a predictive insight into potential salary expectations.
To initiate the application, execute the command ` streamlit run app.py` in the terminal once the model has been trained. This command activates the web server, enabling users to access the application through a web browser by navigating to " http://localhost:8501".
Upon accessing the web application, users will find a user-friendly interface where they can input relevant parameters such as years of experience, years of education, job location, and more. Subsequently, by clicking the "Predict" button, the system will generate and display the predicted salary based on the provided inputs.
It is crucial to note that the predictions generated by this system serve as estimates derived from the data used to train the model. While it provides valuable insights, it may not perfectly predict actual salaries in every scenario. Users should interpret the results with the understanding that they are indicative estimates rather than definitive values.
Dataset Documentation
Overview
The enclosed dataset represents the complete and cleaned results of the 2020 Stack Overflow Developer Survey. To ensure respondent privacy, free response submissions and personally-identifying information have been excluded. Comprising three files—survey_results_public.csv, survey_results_schema.csv, and so_survey_2020.pdf—the dataset encompasses the main survey results, survey schema, and the survey instrument, respectively. To safeguard respondent privacy, free response submissions and personally-identifying information have been meticulously removed.
Conducted from February 5 to February 28, 2020, the survey demanded a median time of 16.6 minutes for qualified responses. Recruitment of respondents primarily took place through Stack Overflow-owned channels, including onsite messaging, blog posts, email lists, Meta posts, banner ads, and social media. This recruitment strategy inherently favored highly engaged Stack Overflow users who were more likely to notice and click on survey links.
As a motivational incentive, respondents completing the survey had the option to opt into a coveted "Census" badge. The dataset, offered under the Open Database License (ODbL) and the Database Contents License (DBCL), empowers users to freely share, adapt, and create derivative works. This freedom is contingent upon attributing Stack Overflow, maintaining the openness of the database during redistribution, and sharing-alike any adapted database under the ODbl.
